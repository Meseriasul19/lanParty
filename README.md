# LanParty
LanParty is a project that performs various tasks based on binary input data. The project reads and processes team and player information to determine the outcomes of these tasks.

## Project Overview
The project consists of several key components:

### 1. Task Simulation

The tasks are represented by 5 binary numbers provided in a file named c.in, located in date folder, next to d.in file. Each numbers indicates whether a specific task should be executed.

### 2. Data Input

The main input file, d.in, contains details about multiple teams. Each team entry includes:

- Team name
- Number of players in the team
- For each player: their name and score

### 3.Task Execution and Verification

The tasks are processed based on the input data, the results being generated in a out.out file, located in out folder.
The correctness of the task execution is verified using a checker script that performs 15 tests. Each test compares the results from 15 output files (r.out files in the results folder) with the output files generated by the code (located in the out folder).


### 4.Automation

A Makefile is included in the project to automate the compilation, execution, and cleanup processes. This simplifies the workflow, allowing for easy building and running of the project.

### 5.Checker Script

The ./checker.sh command is used to open the checker and run the verification tests.

## TASKS

1. TASK1
 - Teams and their data are read from d.in and inserted at the beginning of a list.
2. TASK2
 - Teams with the lowest scores are removed to ensure that the remaining number of teams is the maximum power of 2.
 - The score of a team is calculated as the sum of the scores of its players.
 - If multiple teams have the same score, the first team found in the list is eliminated.
 - After each elimination, the list traversal restarts from the beginning.
3. TASK3
 - A queue is created to manage the matches between teams.
 - Two stacks are used:
    - Winners Stack: Contains teams that won their matches.
    - Losers Stack: Contains teams that lost their matches.
 - Teams are added to the respective stacks based on match outcomes, with winning teams receiving an additional point to their score.
 - In case of a tie, the team that was added first is considered the winner.
4. TASK4
 - The top 8 teams are saved in a new list.
 - The top 8 teams are organized into a Binary Search Tree (BST) based on their scores, and in case of ties, based on their names in descending order.
 - The BST is displayed in descending order of scores.
5. TASK5
 - An AVL tree is constructed with the top 8 teams, sorted similarly to the BST, and the teams at level 2 of the AVL tree are displayed.
